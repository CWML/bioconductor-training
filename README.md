### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a 2-day Introduction to R and BioConductor. This workshop focuses on teaching basic R and data literacy skills to enable the effective use of BioConductor tools for analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. 

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the basics of the programming language R.
2. Learn about BioConductor and the related BioConductor suite of tools.
3. Practise breaking down BioConductor documentation and applying the tools against real data.
