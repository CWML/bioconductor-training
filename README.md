# Introduction to R and Bioconductor

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | None | 2-day workshop (~ 8 hours of trainer-led time) |

### Description

Bioconductor is a website and community that provides (mostly) R-based tools for comprehension and analysis of high-throughput genomic data. The learning materials maintained in this repository focus basic R and data literacy skills that will help enable you to effectively learn about and use of Bioconductor tools. While there will be two indepth examples of Bioconductor tool demonstrations, participants will leave this workshop with the ability to know how to approach any Bioconductor tool. 

> These materials were developed to support self-guided learning, but can also be used to support workshops.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the basics of the programming language R.
2. Learn about Bioconductor and the related Bioconductor suite of tools.
3. Practise breaking down Bioconductor documentation and applying the tools against real data.
